<h1> N-Grams </h1>
<p>
In order to run the code you will have to write the following command:
</p>
<code>
> python main -N 2 -b 0
</code>

<p></p>
<p>
The code will only work if N = {2,3} and b = {0,1} in rest all the cases it will fail.
Also you will have to provide both the flags while executing the code or else it will break!
